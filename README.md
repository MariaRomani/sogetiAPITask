# Sogeti API test task using Rest Assured

## Description
This project demonstrates how to perform API testing using Rest Assured, a Java library for testing RESTful APIs. It includes sample test cases for testing a sample API.

What is Rest Assured?
Rest Assured is a Java library that simplifies the testing of RESTful APIs. 
With Rest Assured, you can easily make HTTP requests, inspect responses, and perform assertions to ensure that your APIs are working correctly. 

Key Features
Simple and Intuitive: Rest Assured provides a clean and expressive syntax for writing API tests, making it easy to understand and maintain test code.
Built on Java: Rest Assured is built on top of Java, making it easy to integrate with existing Java projects and frameworks.
Supports RESTful Concepts: Rest Assured supports common RESTful concepts such as HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), query parameters, headers, and request/response payloads.
Rich Assertion Library: Rest Assured includes a rich set of built-in assertions for validating API responses, including status codes, response body content, headers, and more.
Integration with Testing Frameworks: Rest Assured seamlessly integrates with popular testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG, allowing you to incorporate API tests into your existing test suites.


## Installation
Java Development Kit (JDK)
IntelliJ IDEA

   1. Clone this repository:
   run this command line --> git clone https://github.com/MariaRomani/sogetiAPITask

   2. Ensure you have Java JDK and Maven installed on your machine.
   3. Ensure that the pom.xml file is updated.
   4. The first Test case is under the name of ApiFirstTestCase --> src/test/java/tests/ApiFirstTestCase.java
   you can run that class.
5. The first Test case is under the name of ApiFirstTestCase --> src/test/java/tests/ApiSecondTestCase.java
   you can run that class

## Viewing Test Results
After running the tests, IntelliJ IDEA will display the test results in the "Run" or "Terminal" window at the bottom of the IDE.
You can view detailed information about each test, including pass/fail status and any error messages.

## Troubleshooting
If IntelliJ IDEA doesn't recognize the Rest Assured syntax or imports, make sure that the dependencies are correctly configured in the pom.xml file and that Maven has downloaded them.
If you encounter errors during test execution, double-check your test code for any syntax errors or incorrect configurations.



 #Happy Testing!
